Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
For having traffic with thy self alone,
Then were not summer's distillation left
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
Then of thy beauty do I question make
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
So should the lines of life that life repair
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
O carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
And for a woman wert thou first created,
O let me true in love but truly write,
O therefore love be of thyself so wary,
O let my looks be then the eloquence,
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
The painful warrior famoused for fight,
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
Save that my soul's imaginary sight
I tell the day to please him thou art bright,
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
But ah, thought kills me that I am not thought
Until life's composition be recured,
To side this title is impanelled
So either by thy picture or my love,
Thee have I not locked up in any chest,
Against that time do I ensconce me here
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
But for their virtue only is their show,
'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,
Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
That I might see what the old world could say,
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
O no, thy love though much, is not so great,
But when my glass shows me my self indeed
For such a time do I now fortify
When I have seen such interchange of State,
O fearful meditation, where alack,
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
In him those holy antique hours are seen,
They look into the beauty of thy mind,
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
O if (I say) you look upon this verse,
O lest your true love may seem false in this,
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
O know sweet love I always write of you,
Look what thy memory cannot contain,
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
And do so love, yet when they have devised,
This silence for my sin you did impute,
Let him but copy what in you is writ,
Hearing you praised, I say 'tis so, 'tis true,
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,
And I by this will be a gainer too,
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
Thy love is better than high birth to me,
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
But heaven in thy creation did decree,
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
O what a mansion have those vices got,
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand,
Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
So all their praises are but prophecies
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
So that eternal love in love's fresh case,
Never believe though in my nature reigned,
Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink,
In so profound abysm I throw all care
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,
O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
Thus policy in love t' anticipate
O benefit of ill, now I find true
O that our night of woe might have remembered
No, I am that I am, and they that level
That poor retention could not so much hold,
Thy registers and thee I both defy,
It fears not policy that heretic,
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,
To be so tickled they would change their state
Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know,
And to be sure that is not false I swear,
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
Then in the number let me pass untold,
Why should my heart think that a several plot,
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
For if I should despair I should grow mad,
But my five wits, nor my five senses can
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lov'st those,
So run'st thou after that which flies from thee,
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
'I hate' she altered with an end,
Then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
How can it? O how can love's eye be true,
What merit do I in my self respect,
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse'
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
Where wasteful time debateth with decay
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,
Him in thy course untainted do allow,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
As any mother's child, though not so bright
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
Which like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night,
(Like to the lark at break of day arising
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
That I in thy abundance am sufficed,
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
But that so much of earth and water wrought,
Who even but now come back again assured,
And by their verdict is determined
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
Within the gentle closure of my breast,
And this my hand, against my self uprear,
Which heavily he answers with a groan,
Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
To make some special instant special-blest,
The other as your bounty doth appear,
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
Even in the eyes of all posterity
Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
To what you will, to you it doth belong,
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read:
That he shall never cut from memory
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
For she hath no exchequer now but his,
Making no summer of another's green,
Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
My name be buried where my body is,
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
Possessing or pursuing no delight
So all my best is dressing old words new,
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
Or (being wrecked) I am a worthless boat,
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
For I impair not beauty being mute,
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
But that is in my thought, whose love to you
As victors of my silence cannot boast,
So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
The injuries that to my self I do,
Lest I (too much profane) should do it wronk:
But in the onset come, so shall I taste
Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
O what a happy title do I find,
Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
If any, be a satire to decay,
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb:
But that wild music burthens every bough,
For to no other pass my verses tend,
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand
And in this change is my invention spent,
And for they looked but with divining eyes,
Since spite of him I'll live in this poor rhyme,
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
That it could so preposterously be stained,
On newer proof, to try an older friend,
No bitterness that I will bitter think,
To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
When I was certain o'er incertainty,
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
Bring me within the level of your frown,
And brought to medicine a healthful state
And ruined love when it is built anew
And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
But all alone stands hugely politic,
Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
I grant I never saw a goddess go,
One on another's neck do witness bear
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
So thou being rich in will add to thy will
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold,
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
O love's best habit is in seeming trust,
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
But being both from me both to each friend,
Doth follow night who like a fiend
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
My thoughts and my discourse as mad men's are,
No marvel then though I mistake my view,
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
O though I love what others do abhor,
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
I sick withal the help of bath desired,
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
