Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
But if thou live remembered not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Which used lives th executor to be
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
Be not self willed for thou art much too fair
To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir
So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murdrous shame commits
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
O none but unthrifts dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
To give away your self keeps your self still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
But since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure
Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure
Let them say more that like of hearsay well
I will not praise that purpose not to sell
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
Thou gavst me thine not to give back again
O learn to read what silent love hath writ
To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart
Then happy I that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
For thee and for my self no quiet find
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
And night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
But if the while I think on thee dear friend
All losses are restored and sorrows end
Their images I loved I view in thee
And thou all they hast all the all of me
But since he died and poets better prove
Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
Look what is best that best I wish in thee
This wish I have then ten times happy me
If my slight muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
And that thou teachest how to make one twain
By praising him here who doth hence remain
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
Thine by thy beauty being false to me
But heres the joy my friend and I are one
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
Receiving nought by elements so slow
But heavy tears badges of eithers woe
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad
As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
And my hearts right thy inward love of heart
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight
And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
Since why to love I can allege no cause
For that same groan doth put this in my mind
My grief lies onward and my joy behind
Since from thee going he went wilful slow
Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lacked to hope
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall fade my verse distills your truth
So till the judgment that your self arise
You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes
Or call it winter which being full of care
Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare
So true a fool is love that in your will
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill
I am to wait though waiting so be hell
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
O sure I am the wits of former days
To subjects worse have given admiring praise
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
From me far off with others all too near
Tis thee my self that for my self I praise
Painting my age with beauty of thy days
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright
Tired with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
O him she stores to show what wealth she had
In days long since before these last so bad
And him as for a map doth Nature store
To show false Art what beauty was of yore
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The soil is this that thou dost common grow
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth
This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
You still shall live such virtue hath my pen
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
And their gross painting might be better used
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
But when your countenance filled up his line
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right my self will bear all wrong
For thee against my self Ill vow debate
For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretchcd make
But whats so blessed fair that fears no blot
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not
How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
The hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the winters near
Yet seemed it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead
Fair kind and true have often lived alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
To this I witness call the fools of time
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime
Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
When most impeached stands least in thy control
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
That every tongue says beauty should look so
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one Will
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovst me for my name is Will
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferred
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flattered be
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
By self example mayst thou be denied
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
I hate from hate away she threw
And saved my life saying not you
So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
And death once dead theres no more dying then
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
Lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I
To swear against the truth so foul a be
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes
Came there for cure and this by that I prove
Loves fire heats water water cools not love
