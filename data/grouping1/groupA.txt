From fairest creatures we desire increase
But as the riper should by time decease
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
Will play the tyrants to the very same
Then let not winters ragged hand deface
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Doth homage to his new appearing sight
Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst
When I do count the clock that tells the time
When I behold the violet past prime
O that you were your self but love you are
Against this coming end you should prepare
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
But not to tell of good or evil luck
When I consider every thing that grows
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
And fortify your self in your decay
Who will believe my verse in time to come
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Shall I compare thee to a summers day
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
A womans face with natures own hand painted
A womans gentle heart but not acquainted
So is it not with me as with that muse
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use
My glass shall not persuade me I am old
But when in thee times furrows I behold
As an unperfect actor on the stage
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
My body is the frame wherein tis held
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
To thee I send this written embassage
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
But then begins a journey in my head
How can I then return in happy plight
When days oppression is not eased by night
When in disgrace with Fortune and mens eyes
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
And there reigns love and all loves loving parts
If thou survive my well contented day
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
To let base clouds oertake me in my way
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
Let me confess that we two must be twain
So shall those blots that do with me remain
As a decrepit father takes delight
So I made lame by Fortunes dearest spite
How can my muse want subject to invent
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
O how thy worth with manners may I sing
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
Take all my loves my love yea take them all
No love my love that thou mayst true love call
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
That thou hast her it is not all my grief
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
For then despite of space I would be brought
The other two slight air and purging fire
The first my thought the other my desire
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
When that mine eye is famished for a look
How careful was I when I took my way
That to my use it might unused stay
Against that time if ever that time come
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
How heavy do I journey on the way
Doth teach that case and that repose to say
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
From where thou art why should I haste me thence
So am I as the rich whose blessed key
The which he will not every hour survey
What is your substance whereof are you made
Since every one hath every one one shade
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
Not marble nor the gilded monuments
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
Which but today by feeding is allayed
Being your slave what should I do but tend
I have no precious time at all to spend
That god forbid that made me first your slave
Or at your hand th account of hours to crave
If there be nothing new but that which is
Which labouring for invention bear amis
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
Each changing place with that which goes before
Is it thy will thy image should keep open
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
Sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
And for this sin there is no remedy
Against my love shall be as I am now
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced
When sometime lofty towers I see down rased
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Tired with all these for restful death I cry
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity
Ah wherefore with infection should he live
That sin by him advantage should achieve
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
Before these bastard signs of fair were born
Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
The ornament of beauty is suspect
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Give warning to the world that I am fled
O lest the world should task you to recite
After my death dear love forget me quite
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
But be contented when that fell arrest
My life hath in this line some interest
So are you to my thoughts as food to life
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
Why is my verse so barren of new pride
Why with the time do I not glance aside
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
As every alien pen hath got my use
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
But now my gracious numbers are decayed
O how I faint when I of you do write
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
From hence your memory death cannot take
I grant thou wert not married to my muse
The dedicated words which writers use
I never saw that you did painting need
I found or thought I found you did exceed
Who is it that says most which can say more
In whose confine immured is the store
My tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
Reserve their character with golden quill
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
Upon thy side against my self Ill fight
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their garments though new fangled ill
But do thy worst to steal thy self away
And life no longer than thy love will stay
So shall I live supposing thou art true
May still seem love to me though altered new
They that have power to hurt and will do none
Who moving others are themselves as stone
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
How like a winter hath my absence been
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
From you have I been absent in the spring
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long
Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth
The argument all bare is of more worth
To me fair friend you never can be old
Such seems your beauty still three winters cold
Let not my love be called idolatry
Since all alike my songs and praises be
When in the chronicle of wasted time
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Whats in the brain that ink may character
Whats new to speak what now to register
O never say that I was false of heart
As easy might I from my self depart
Alas tis true I have gone here and there
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
That did not better for my life provide
Your love and pity doth th impression fill
For what care I who calls me well or ill
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Which alters when it alteration finds
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
Forgot upon your dearest love to call
Like as to make our appetite more keen
As to prevent our maladies unseen
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
That you were once unkind befriends me now
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Which shall above that idle rank remain
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
If my dear love were but the child of state
As subject to times love or to times hate
Weret aught to me I bore the canopy
Or laid great bases for eternity
In the old age black was not counted fair
But now is black beautys successive heir
How oft when thou my music music playst
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
Ist not enough to torture me alone
So now I have confessed that he is thine
My self Ill forfeit so that other mine
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
More than enough am I that vex thee still
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
They know what beauty is see where it lies
When my love swears that she is made of truth
That she might think me some untutored youth
O call not me to justify the wrong
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
But tis my heart that loves what they despise
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
The better angel is a man right fair
Those lips that Loves own hand did make
To me that languished for her sake
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
My love is as a fever longing still
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
O me what eyes hath love put in my head
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
To make me give the lie to my true sight
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn
In act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
And his love kindling fire did quickly steep
The little Love god lying once asleep
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
