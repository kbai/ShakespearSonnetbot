But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Making a famine where abundance lies
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
For never resting time leads summer on
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
That use is not forbidden usury
Thats for thy self to breed another thee
And having climbed the steep up heavenly hill
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
If the true concord of well tuned sounds
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
The world will be thy widow and still weep
When every private widow well may keep
For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
If all were minded so the times should cease
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
And summers green all girded up in sheaves
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Your self again after your selfs decease
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Or say with princes if it shall go well
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
The age to come would say this poet lies
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And every fair from fair sometime declines
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
A man in hue all hues in his controlling
Making a couplement of proud compare
With Aprils first born flowers and all things rare
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
So I for fear of trust forget to say
And in mine own loves strength seem to decay
For through the painter must you see his skill
Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
And in themselves their pride lies buried
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
For then my thoughts from far where I abide
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
And each though enemies to eithers reign
The one by toil the other to complain
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow
And weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe
How many a holy and obsequious tear
As interest of the dead which now appear
Compare them with the bettring of the time
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
For no man well of such a salve can speak
All men make faults and even I in this
My self corrupting salving thy amiss
In our two loves there is but one respect
Which though it alter not loves sole effect
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
Even for this let us divided live
That by this separation I may give
Then if for my love thou my love receivest
But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
And when a woman woos what womans son
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
No matter then although my foot did stand
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
For when these quicker elements are gone
My life being made of four with two alone
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
But the defendant doth that plea deny
With my loves picture then my eye doth feast
Another time mine eye is my hearts guest
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
When love converted from the thing it was
The beast that bears me tired with my woe
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
O what excuse will my poor beast then find
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
On Helens cheek all art of beauty set
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
So love be thou although today thou fill
Tomorrow see again and do not kill
Nor dare I chide the world without end hour
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
O let me suffer being at your beck
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
O that record could with a backward look
Show me your image in some antique book
Nativity once in the main of light
Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight
Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
To find out shames and idle hours in me
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
And for my self mine own worth do define
Hath travelled on to ages steepy night
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
And the firm soil win of the watery main
O how shall summers honey breath hold out
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Before the golden tresses of the dead
To live a second life on second head
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
In other accents do this praise confound
So thou be good slander doth but approve
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
Nay if you read this line remember not
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
And hang more praise upon deceased I
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
Which by and by black night doth take away
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The earth can have but earth which is his due
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Now counting best to be with you alone
Why write I still all one ever the same
That every word doth almost tell my name
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
Have added feathers to the learneds wing
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
But since your worth wide as the ocean is
My saucy bark inferior far to his
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
The earth can yield me but a common grave
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
And therefore have I slept in your report
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
But he that writes of you if he can tell
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
To every hymn that able spirit affords
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
No neither he nor his compeers by night
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will
Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
But these particulars are not my measure
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
I see a better state to me belongs
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
In manys looks the false hearts history
They rightly do inherit heavens graces
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
As on the finger of a throned queen
So are those errors that in thee are seen
And yet this time removed was summers time
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Could make me any summers story tell
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
Our love was new and then but in the spring
As Philomel in summers front doth sing
O blame me not if I no more can write
That over goes my blunt invention quite
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned
Kind is my love today tomorrow kind
Therefore my verse to constancy confined
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
I see their antique pen would have expressed
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
Most true it is that I have looked on truth
These blenches gave my heart another youth
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
To what it works in like the dyers hand
You are my all the world and I must strive
None else to me nor I to none alive
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
To make of monsters and things indigest
Creating every bad a perfect best
But reckoning time whose millioned accidents
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
O no it is an ever fixed mark
It is the star to every wandring bark
That I have frequent been with unknown minds
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Even so being full of your neer cloying sweetness
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
For why should others false adulterate eyes
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
And rather make them born to our desire
No it was builded far from accident
Under the blow of thralled discontent
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
For since each hand hath put on natures power
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
I have seen roses damasked red and white
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
To say they err I dare not be so bold
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
Of him my self and thee I am forsaken
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
He learned but surety like to write for me
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Shall will in others seem right gracious
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
In things of great receipt with case we prove
If eyes corrupt by over partial looks
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue
Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
If I might teach thee wit better it were
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
Nor are mine cars with thy tongues tune delighted
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
To follow that which flies before her face
To win me soon to hell my female evil
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Was used in giving gentle doom
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
My reason the physician to my love
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
If it be not then love doth well denote
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
For thou betraying me I do betray
My soul doth tell my body that he may
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
The fairest votary took up that fire
And so the general of hot desire
