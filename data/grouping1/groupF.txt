And only herald to the gaudy spring
And tender churl makst waste in niggarding
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Proving his beauty by succession thine
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Leaving thee living in posterity
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
From his low tract and look another way
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
And kept unused the user so destroys it
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Or to thy self at least kind hearted prove
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
That thou among the wastes of time must go
And die as fast as they see others grow
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
And constant stars in them I read such art
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
To change your day of youth to sullied night
Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen
Can make you live your self in eyes of men
Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
And stretched metre of an antique song
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
When in eternal lines to time thou growst
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
For beautys pattern to succeeding men
Till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
And then believe me my love is as fair
As those gold candles fixed in heavens air
As I not for my self but for thee will
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
After a thousand victories once foiled
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
Haply I think on thee and then my state
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
Which I new pay as if not paid before
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
That due of many now is thine alone
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
To march in ranks of better equipage
With all triumphant splendour on my brow
The region cloud hath masked him from me now
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
To him that bears the strong offences cross
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
Such civil war is in my love and hate
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
And by a part of all thy glory live
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
To bear greater wrong than hates known injury
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
By looking on thee in the living day
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
I must attend times leisure with my moan
By those swift messengers returned from thee
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
Thy self away art present still with me
And I am still with them and they with thee
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
Within the knowledge of mine own desert
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
Therefore desire of perfectst love being made
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
And you in every blessed shape we know
They live unwooed and unrespected fade
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
That wear this world out to the ending doom
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Return of love more blest may be the view
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
Save where you are how happy you make those
That you your self may privilage your time
Your self to pardon of selfdoing crime
To this composed wonder of your frame
Or whether revolution be the same
And delves the parallels in beautys brow
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
Self so self loving were iniquity
Against confounding ages cruel knife
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
Or state it self confounded to decay
That Time will come and take my love away
Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
And folly doctor like controlling skill
And captive good attending captain ill
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
And proud of many lives upon his gains
Without all ornament it self and true
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
Either not assailed or victor being charged
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
But let your love even with my life decay
That you for love speak well of me untrue
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
The prey of worms my body being dead
Too base of thee to be remembered
And by and by clean starved for a look
Save what is had or must from you be took
And you and love are still my argument
Spending again what is already spent
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Which eyes not yet created shall oer read
When all the breathers of this world are dead
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
In true plain words by thy true telling friend
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
When others would give life and bring a tomb
Not making worse what nature made so clear
Making his style admired every where
And to the most of praise add something more
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
I was not sick of any fear from thence
Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
Comes home again on better judgement making
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
Doing thee vantage double vantage me
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
When other petty griefs have done their spite
At first the very worst of fortunes might
Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
And having thee of all mens pride I boast
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
Happy to have thy love happy to die
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
Though to it self it only live and die
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
Which for their habitation chose out thee
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
And thou away the very birds are mute
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
If time have any wrinkle graven there
And make times spoils despised everywhere
Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
And to be praised of ages yet to be
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
To mar the subject that before was well
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
Fair kind and true varying to other words
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
Of this our time all you prefiguring
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
But makes antiquity for aye his page
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
Mine appetite I never more will grind
A god in love to whom I am confined
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
Nor double penance to correct correction
Of others voices that my adders sense
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
The most sweet favour or deformedst creature
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
Might I not then say Now I love you best
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Within his bending sickles compass come
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
And on just proof surmise accumulate
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
That better is by evil still made better
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
At my abuses reckon up their own
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
To trust those tables that receive thee more
Not wondring at the present nor the past
Made more or less by thy continual haste
Which works on leases of short numbered hours
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
And take thou my oblation poor but free
But mutual render only me for thee
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
Slandering creation with a false esteem
And situation with those dancing chips
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Had having and in quest to have extreme
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
And suit thy pity like in every part
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
And in abundance addeth to his store
One will of mine to make thy large will more
Though in thy stores account I one must be
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
And wherefore say not I that I am old
And age in love loves not to have years told
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
I guess one angel in anothers hell
That followed it as gentle day
From heaven to hell is flown away
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Within be fed without be rich no more
And frantic mad with evermore unrest
At random from the truth vainly expressed
That is so vexed with watching and with tears
The sun it self sees not till heaven clears
That is so proud thy service to despise
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
As his triumphant prize proud of this pride
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
Or made them swear against the thing they see
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
And thither hied a sad distempered guest
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
For men discased but I my mistress thrall
