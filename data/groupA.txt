From fairest creatures we desire increase,
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
Then let not winters ragged hand deface,
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Music to hear, why hearst thou music sadly?
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye,
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst,
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
O that you were your self, but love you are
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,
When I consider every thing that grows
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Who will believe my verse in time to come
Shall I compare thee to a summers day?
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws,
A womans face with natures own hand painted,
So is it not with me as with that muse,
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
As an unperfect actor on the stage,
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
Let those who are in favour with their stars,
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
How can I then return in happy plight
When in disgrace with Fortune and mens eyes,
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
If thou survive my well-contented day,
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
Let me confess that we two must be twain,
As a decrepit father takes delight,
How can my muse want subject to invent
O how thy worth with manners may I sing,
Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see,
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
How careful was I when I took my way,
Against that time (if ever that time come)
How heavy do I journey on the way,
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
So am I as the rich whose blessed key,
What is your substance, whereof are you made,
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
Being your slave what should I do but tend,
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
If there be nothing new, but that which is,
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
Against my love shall be as I am now
When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
Tired with all these for restful death I cry,
Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view,
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,
O lest the world should task you to recite,
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
But be contented when that fell arrest,
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse,
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
O how I faint when I of you do write,
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
I grant thou wert not married to my muse,
I never saw that you did painting need,
Who is it that says most, which can say more,
My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
How like a winter hath my absence been
From you have I been absent in the spring,
Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long,
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
To me fair friend you never can be old,
Let not my love be called idolatry,
When in the chronicle of wasted time,
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
Whats in the brain that ink may character,
O never say that I was false of heart,
Alas tis true, I have gone here and there,
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
Your love and pity doth th impression fill,
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
Like as to make our appetite more keen
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
That you were once unkind befriends me now,
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
No! Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change,
If my dear love were but the child of state,
Weret aught to me I bore the canopy,
In the old age black was not counted fair,
How oft when thou, my music, music playst,
Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun,
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
Thine eyes I love, and they as pitying me,
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
So now I have confessed that he is thine,
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
If thy soul check thee that I come so near,
Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
O call not me to justify the wrong,
Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes,
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch,
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
Those lips that Loves own hand did make,
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,
My love is as a fever longing still,
O me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
Canst thou O cruel, say I love thee not,
O from what power hast thou this powerful might,
Love is too young to know what conscience is,
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn,
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
The little Love-god lying once asleep,
But as the riper should by time decease,
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
Will play the tyrants to the very same,
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly,
Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst,
When I behold the violet past prime,
Against this coming end you should prepare,
But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
And fortify your self in your decay
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws,
A womans gentle heart but not acquainted
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
But when in thee times furrows I behold,
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
My body is the frame wherein tis held,
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
To thee I send this written embassage
But then begins a journey in my head
When days oppression is not eased by night,
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And there reigns love and all loves loving parts,
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
To let base clouds oertake me in my way,
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
So shall those blots that do with me remain,
So I, made lame by Fortunes dearest spite
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
For then despite of space I would be brought,
The first my thought, the other my desire,
Mine eye, my heart thy pictures sight would bar,
When that mine eye is famished for a look,
That to my use it might unused stay
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
Doth teach that case and that repose to say
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence?
The which he will not every hour survey,
Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
I have no precious time at all to spend;
Or at your hand th account of hours to crave,
Which labouring for invention bear amis
Each changing place with that which goes before,
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
And for this sin there is no remedy,
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
When sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
That sin by him advantage should achieve,
Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
The ornament of beauty is suspect,
Give warning to the world that I am fled
After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
My life hath in this line some interest,
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
Why with the time do I not glance aside
These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear,
As every alien pen hath got my use,
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
From hence your memory death cannot take,
The dedicated words which writers use
I found (or thought I found) you did exceed,
In whose confine immured is the store,
Reserve their character with golden quill,
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
Upon thy side, against my self Ill fight,
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt:
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
May still seem love to me, though altered new:
Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing:
Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song,
Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,
The argument all bare is of more worth
Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
Since all alike my songs and praises be
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Whats new to speak, what now to register,
As easy might I from my self depart,
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
That did not better for my life provide,
For what care I who calls me well or ill,
Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true,
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
As to prevent our maladies unseen,
Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
Needs must I under my transgression bow,
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
Which shall above that idle rank remain
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange,
As subject to times love or to times hate,
Or laid great bases for eternity,
But now is black beautys successive heir,
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
Is perjured, murdrous, bloody full of blame,
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
Ist not enough to torture me alone,
My self Ill forfeit, so that other mine,
More than enough am I that vex thee still,
And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
But tis my heart that loves what they despise,
O but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
The better angel is a man right fair:
To me that languished for her sake:
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
