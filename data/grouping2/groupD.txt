Feedst thy lights flame with self substantial fuel
Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
Were an all eating shame and thriftless praise
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Of his self love to stop posterity
The bounteous largess given thee to give
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Beauty oer snowed and bareness every where
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
By unions married do offend thine ear
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
Without this folly age and cold decay
And threescore year would make the world away
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Find no determination then you were
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
By oft predict that I in heaven find
Cheered and checked even by the self same sky
And wear their brave state out of memory
And many maiden gardens yet unset
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed
And do whateer thou wilt swift footed Time
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
That heavens air in this huge rondure hems
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
How can I then be elder than thou art
The perfect ceremony of loves rite
Oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might
To find where your true image pictured lies
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
But as the marigold at the suns eye
For at a frown they in their glory die
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
How far I toil still farther off from thee
Featured like him like him with friends possessed
With what I most enjoy contented least
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
And moan th expense of many a vanished sight
Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
But things removed that hidden in thee lie
And though they be outstripped by every pen
Exceeded by the height of happier men
With ugly rack on his celestial face
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
To dry the rain on my storm beaten face
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
Though in our lives a separable spite
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
Or any of these all or all or more
I make my love engrafted to this store
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
When thou thy self dost give invention light
And our dear love lose name of single one
That due to thee which thou deservst alone
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
By wilful taste of what thy self refusest
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her
Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her
How would thy shadows form form happy show
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
As soon as think the place where he would be
In tender embassy of love to thee
Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes
And says in him thy fair appearance lies
And to the painted banquet bids my heart
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
Shall reasons find of settled gravity
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
His rider loved not speed being made from thee
When swift extremity can seem but slow
In winged speed no motion shall I know
Since seldom coming in that long year set
Or captain jewels in the carcanet
Is poorly imitated after you
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
As the perfumed tincture of the roses
When summers breath their masked buds discloses
And broils root out the work of masonry
The living record of your memory
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Th imprisoned absence of your liberty
Without accusing you of injury
Even of five hundred courses of the sun
Since mind at first in character was done
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
So far from home into my deeds to pry
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
No shape so true no truth of such account
As I all other in all worths surmount
And all those beauties whereof now hes king
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
Increasing store with loss and loss with store
Against the wrackful siege of battring days
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And strength by limping sway disabled
And steal dead seeming of his living hue
Roses of shadow since his rose is true
The right of sepulchres were shorn away
Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
And thou presentst a pure unstained prime
The hand that writ it for I love you so
If thinking on me then should make you woe
To do more for me than mine own desert
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
The very part was consecrate to thee
My spirit is thine the better part of me
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
And keep invention in a noted weed
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Times thievish progress to eternity
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
And given grace a double majesty
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Though I once gone to all the world must die
When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
Some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
That you your self being extant well might show
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
That to his subject lends not some small glory
That you are you so dignifies his story
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
In polished form of well refined pen
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
Giving him aid my verse astonished
And for that riches where is my deserving
And so my patent back again is swerving
Upon thy part I can set down a story
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
To set a form upon desired change
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe
To linger out a purposed overthrow
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
All these I better in one general best
When in the least of them my life hath end
Than that which on thy humour doth depend
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
And husband natures riches from expense
Others but stewards of their excellence
Making lascivious comments on thy sport
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
The basest jewel will be well esteemed
To truths translated and for true things deemed
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Like widowed wombs after their lords decease
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
But best is best if never intermixed
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Look in your glass and there appears a face
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
In process of the seasons have I seen
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
One thing expressing leaves out difference
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
Even such a beauty as you master now
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
I must each day say oer the very same
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name
Like him that travels I return again
So that my self bring water for my stain
Askance and strangely but by all above
And worse essays proved thee my best of love
And almost thence my nature is subdued
Pity me then and wish I were renewed
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
Divert strong minds to the course of altring things
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
And given to time your own dear purchased right
Which should transport me farthest from your sight
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
To be diseased ere that there was true needing
Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
In the distraction of this madding fever
As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Of thee thy record never can be missed
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
Than think that we before have heard them told
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face
But is profaned if not lives in disgrace
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
Although I swear it to my self alone
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Doth half that glory to the sober west
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed
A torment thrice three fold thus to be crossed
For thou art covetous and he is kind
Under that bond that him as fist doth bind
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
Among a number one is reckoned none
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Although she knows my days are past the best
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
No news but health from their physicians know
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
To any sensual feast with thee alone
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
Not prizing her poor infants discontent
Tempteth my better angel from my side
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
And taught it thus anew to greet
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Desire is death which physic did except
What means the world to say it is not so
Loves eye is not so true as all mens no
On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon
Revenge upon my self with present moan
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
My nobler part to my gross bodys treason
Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
When I break twenty I am perjured most
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
A dateless lively heat still to endure
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
Those lamping eyes will deign sometimes to look
Written with tears in hearts close bleeding book
In which thou lurkest like to vipers brood
And also to sustain thy self with food
Base things I can no more endure to view
At wondrous sight of so celestial hew
Fresh love that long hath slept in cheerless bower
His wanton wings and darts of deadly power
Scorn of base things and sdeigne of foul dishonor
That loosely they ne dare to look upon her
Is long ere it conceive the kindling fire
Great heat and makes his flames to heaven aspire
Then is my soul with life and love inspired
Then do I die as one with lightning fired
Shoot out his darts to base affections wound
In chaste desires on heavenly beauty bound
Nor to the moon for they are changed never
Nor to the fire for they consume not ever
The huge massacres which her eyes do make
That thou of them mayst mighty vengeance take
To grant small respite to my restless toil
Of my poor life to make unpityed spoil
A wicked ambush which lay hidden long
Thence breaking forth did thick about me throng
For looking on the earth whence she was born
What so is fairest shall to earth return
Than those small forts which ye were wont belay
Disdain to yield unto the first assay
All this worlds riches that may far be found
If rubies lo her lips be rubies sound
Legions of loves with little wings did fly
At every rash beholder passing by
And eke his learned hand at pleasure guide
Yet many wondrous things there are beside
And long entreaty soften her hard heart
Or look with pity on my painful smart
Their anthems sweet devised of loves praise
As if they knew the meaning of their lays
And reighneth over every beast in field
The silly lamb that to his might doth yield
She to her love doth lookers eyes allure
Their looser looks that stir up lusts impure
In which her glorious image placed is
Like sacred priests that never think amiss
Thimportune suit of my desire to shun
In one short hour I find by her undone
Which her fair eyes unwares do work in me
I think that I a new Pandora see
And show the last ensample of your pride
To prove your power which I too well have tried
Sweet is the nut but bitter is his pill
And sweet is Moly but his root is ill
Shall doff her fleshs borrowed fair attire
That many now much worship and admire
Let in likewise your gentle breast inspire
Of that proud maid whom now those leave attire
Yielded them by the vanquished as their meeds
To sing the glory of their famous deeds
Is not delayed by her heart frozen cold
And feel my flames augmented manifold
A dreadful countenance she given hath
And warn to shun the danger of their wrath
Her heart more hard than iron soft a whit
Do beat on thanvil of her stubborn wit
Do ye not think theaccomplishment of it
All were it as the rest but rudely writ
Me to direct with clouds is overcast
Through hidden perils round about me plast
And having it they gaze on it the more
Whose eyes him starvd so plenty makes me poor
Or make agreement with her thrilling eyes
And daily more augment my miseries
She may entangle in that golden snare
Their weaker hearts which are not well aware
Some dainty ears cannot with any skill
Nor move the dolphin from her stubborn will
For when on me thou shinedst late in sadness
And me revived with heart robbing gladness
Unto the fair sunshine in summers day
Through the broad world doth spread his goodly ray
that she will plague the man that loves her most
Then all her natures goodly gifts are lost
To be acquit from my continual smart
And yield for pledge my poor captived heart
And eke my tongue with proud restraint to tie
But like a stupid stock in silence die
The which myself against myself do make
No skill can stint nor reason can aslake
Thing so divine to view of earthly eye
And every part remains immortally
The heavens know best what is the best form
My lower heaven so it perforce must be
Unto her love and tempt to their decay
And feeds at pleasure on the wretched pray
Then so bad end for heretics ordained
But plead thy masters cause unjustly pained
To show the power of your imperious eyes
But bend your force against your enemies
In deep discovery of the minds disease
And rules the members as itself doth please
Her hardness blame which I should more commend
Which was not hard tachieve and bring to end
To sorrow and to solitary pain
Longwhile alone in languor to remain
For with the goodly semblance of her hue
And then no mercy will unto me shew
And mask in mirth like to a comedy
I wail and make my woes a tragedy
Not water for her love doth burn like fire
Not fire for she doth freeze with faint desire
As is a storm that all things doth prostrate
Beats on it strongly it to ruinate
That wonder is how I should live a jot
With thousand arrows which your eyes have shot
The raging waves and keeps her course aright
Ne aught for fairer weather false delight
Began in me to move one year is spent
Than all those forty which my life outwent
And of the brood of angels heavenly born
Each of which did her with their gifts adorn
Change each our minds and former lives amend
And fly the faults with which we did offend
In which I hope ere long for to arrive
Of all that dear and dainty is alive
Her ruddy cheeks like unto Roses red
Her lovely eyes like Pinks but newly spread
Without constraint or dread of any ill
Within her cage but sings and feeds her fill
Could not on earth have found one fit for mate
Why did ye stoop unto so lowly state
When I all weary had the chase forsook
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook
And grant that we for whom thou didst die
May live for ever in felicity
In which I may record the memory
Adornd with honour love and chastity
Yet in her winters bower not well awake
Unless she do him by the forelock take
Of a dear foe and thralled to his love
So firmly that ye never may remove
Resembling heavens glory in her light
And unto heaven forgets her former flight
Desired food to it doth make his flight
To feed his fill flys back unto your sight
From mothers womb derivd by due descent
That honour and large riches to me lent
A mortal thing so to immortalize
And eek my name be wiped out likewise
And my frail thoughts too rashly led astray
On the sweet spoil of beauty they did prey
Two golden apples of unvalued price
Or those which Atalanta did entice
I seek her bower with her late presence decked
Yet field and bower are full of her aspect
Shall turn to naught and loose that glorious hue
From frail corruption that doth flesh ensue
Out of my prison I will break anew
With strong endeavor and attention due
With precious merchandise she forth doth lay
Her goodly light with smiles she drives away
In this as in the rest ye mote invent
Your glorious name in golden monument
And seeing it they gaze on it the more
Whose eyes him starvd so plenty makes me poor
All that they know not envy or admire
But not to deem of her desert aspire
Upon thee fall for thine accursed hire
In my true love did stir up coals of ire
I wish that night the noyous day would end
I wish that day would shortly reascend
When others gaze upon their shadows vain
Whereof some glance doth in mine eye remain
Mourn to myself the absence of my love
Seek with my plaints to match that mournful dove
