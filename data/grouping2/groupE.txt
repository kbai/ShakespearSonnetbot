Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
For having traffic with thy self alone
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
Then were not summers distillation left
Beautys effect with beauty were bereft
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
The eyes fore duteous now converted are
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
But beautys waste hath in the world an end
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Let those whom nature hath not made for store
Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
Then of thy beauty do I question make
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Against the stormy gusts of winters day
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Where wasteful time debateth with decay
So should the lines of life that life repair
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
So should my papers yellowed with their age
And your true rights be termed a poets rage
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade
O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
Him in thy course untainted do allow
And for a woman wert thou first created
And by addition me of thee defeated
O let me true in love but truly write
As any mothers child though not so bright
O therefore love be of thyself so wary
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
O let my looks be then the eloquence
Who plead for love and look for recompense
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Are windows to my breast where through the sun
The painful warrior famoused for fight
Is from the book of honour razed quite
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
And puts apparel on my tattered loving
Save that my souls imaginary sight
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
So flatter I the swart complexioned night
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
Like to the lark at break of day arising
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
The sad account of fore bemoaned moan
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
But out alack he was but one hour mine
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
And gainst my self a lawful plea commence
I may not evermore acknowledge thee
Nor thou with public kindness honour me
So then I am not lame poor nor despised
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
Who lead thee in their riot even there
If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain
Both find each other and I lose both twain
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
But that so much of earth and water wrought
Until lifes composition be recured
Who even but now come back again assured
To side this title is impanelled
And by their verdict is determined
So either by thy picture or my love
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
Thee have I not locked up in any chest
Within the gentle closure of my breast
Against that time do I ensconce me here
And this my hand against my self uprear
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
Which heavily he answers with a groan
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
To make some special instant special blest
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The other as your bounty doth appear
But for their virtue only is their show
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
Gainst death and all oblivious enmity
Even in the eyes of all posterity
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Come daily to the banks that when they see
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Be where you list your charter is so strong
To what you will to you it doth belong
That I might see what the old world could say
Whether we are mended or whether better they
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
Feeds on the rarities of natures truth
O no thy love though much is not so great
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
But when my glass shows me my self indeed
Mine own self love quite contrary I read
For such a time do I now fortify
That he shall never cut from memory
When I have seen such interchange of State
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
O fearful meditation where alack
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
And art made tongue tied by authority
And simple truth miscalled simplicity
Why should he live now nature bankrupt is
For she hath no exchequer now but his
In him those holy antique hours are seen
Making no summer of anothers green
They look into the beauty of thy mind
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
O if I say you look upon this verse
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
O lest your true love may seem false in this
My name be buried where my body is
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
As the death bed whereon it must expire
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The coward conquest of a wretchs knife
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
Possessing or pursuing no delight
O know sweet love I always write of you
So all my best is dressing old words new
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Those children nursed delivered from thy brain
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
In others works thou dost but mend the style
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
And do so love yet when they have devised
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
This silence for my sin you did impute
For I impair not beauty being mute
Let him but copy what in you is writ
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true
But that is in my thought whose love to you
He nor that affable familiar ghost
As victors of my silence cannot boast
Thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
And I by this will be a gainer too
The injuries that to my self I do
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Lest I too much profane should do it wronk
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
But in the onset come so shall I taste
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Of more delight than hawks and horses be
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
O what a happy title do I find
But heaven in thy creation did decree
Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
The summers flower is to the summer sweet
But if that flower with base infection meet
O what a mansion have those vices got
Where beautys veil doth cover every blot
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey
If any be a satire to decay
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
But that wild music burthens every bough
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
For to no other pass my verses tend
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Fair kind and true is all my argument
And in this change is my invention spent
So all their praises are but prophecies
And for they looked but with divining eyes
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme
So that eternal love in loves fresh case
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
Never believe though in my nature reigned
That it could so preposterously be stained
Now all is done have what shall have no end
On newer proof to try an older friend
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
No bitterness that I will bitter think
In so profound abysm I throw all care
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight
The mountain or the sea the day or night
O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
Alas why fearing of times tyranny
When I was certain oer incertainty
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
Book both my wilfulness and errors down
Bring me within the level of your frown
Thus policy in love t anticipate
And brought to medicine a healthful state
O benefit of ill now I find true
And ruined love when it is built anew
O that our night of woe might have remembered
And soon to you as you to me then tendered
No I am that I am and they that level
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
That poor retention could not so much hold
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
Thy registers and thee I both defy
For thy records and what we see doth lie
It fears not policy that heretic
But all alone stands hugely politic
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black
At such who not born fair no beauty lack
To be so tickled they would change their state
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
I grant I never saw a goddess go
And to be sure that is not false I swear
One on anothers neck do witness bear
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
The sea all water yet receives rain still
So thou being rich in will add to thy will
Then in the number let me pass untold
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
O loves best habit is in seeming trust
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
For if I should despair I should grow mad
Now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
So runst thou after that which flies from thee
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
And whether that my angel be turned fiend
But being both from me both to each friend
I hate she altered with an end
Doth follow night who like a fiend
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Past cure I am now reason is past care
My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are
How can it O how can loves eye be true
No marvel then though I mistake my view
What merit do I in my self respect
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
O though I love what others do abhor
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
But at my mistress eye Loves brand new fired
I sick withal the help of bath desired
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
And happy rhymes bathd in the sacred brook
When ye behold that Angels blessed look
But if in presence of that fairest proud
And with meek humbless and afflicted mood
So when my tongue would speak her praises due
And when my pen would write her titles true
For lusty spring now in his timely hour
And warns the Earth with diverse colored flower
Such pride is praise such portliness is honor
And her fair countenance like a goodly banner
So hard it is to kindle new desire
Deep is the wound that dints the parts entire
But since that life is more than death desired
That your bright beams of my weak eyes admired
You frame my thoughts and fashion me within
You calm the storm that passion did begin
Nor to the lightening for they still persever
Nor unto crystal for nought may them sever
But her proud heart do thou a little shake
All this worlds pride bow to a baser make
Yet my poor life all sorrows to assoyle
But then she seeks with torment and turmoil
Too feeble I tabide the brunt so strong
Who me captiving straight with rigorous wrong
But that same lofty countenance seems to scorn
Treading down earth as lothsome and forlorn
Bring therefore all the forces that ye may
Plaints prayers vows ruth sorrow and dismay
If pearls her teeth be pearls both pure and round
If gold her locks are finest gold on ground
One of those archers closely I did spy
When suddenly with twinkle of her eye
The sweet eye glances that like arrows glide
The lovely pleasance and the lofty pride
But when I plead she bids me play my part
And when I sigh she says I know the art
But mongst them all which did Loves honor raise
But she his precept proudly disobeys
But she more cruel and more savage wild
Shames not to be with guiltless blood defiled
With such strange terms her eyes she doth inure
And with another doth it straight recure
There I to her as thauthor of my bliss
And on the same my heart will sacrifice
So when I think to end that I begun
For with one look she spills that long I spun
Whom all the Gods in council did agree
That she to wicked men a scourge should be
But yet if in your hardened breast ye hide
Then all the woes and wrecks which I abide
So every sweet with sour is tempered still
For easy things that may be got at will
Ne any then shall after it inquire
But what this verse that never shall expire
Proud Daphne scorning Phoebus lovely fire
For which the gods in their revengeful ire
But sith she will the conquest challenge needs
That her great triumph which my skill exceeds
What more miraculous thing may be told
And ice which is congealed with senseless cold
But my proud one doth work the greater scath
That she the better may in bloody bath
But still the more she fervent sees my fit
And harder grows the harder she is smit
How then should I without another wit
Sins that this one is tossed with troublous fit
Yet hope I well that when this storm is past
Will shine again and look on me at last
Yet are mine eyes so filled with the store
But loath the things which they did like before
But when ye have shewed all extermities
By slaying him whose life though ye dispise
Take heed therefore mine eyes how ye do stare
In which if ever ye entrapped are
But in her pride she doth persever still
Yet with one word she can in save or spill
Whylest rapt with joy resembling heavenly madness
And feeling thence no more her sorrows sadness
At sight whereof each bird that sits on spray
Comes forth afresh out of their late dismay
And that same glorious beautys idle boast
As being long in her loves tempest tossed
The which that it from her may never start
And from all wandering loves which mote pervert
Yet I my heart with silence secretly
And eke mine eyes with meek humility
But when in hand my tuneless harp I take
And grief renew and passions do awake
And were it not that through your cruelty
The goodly image of your visnomy
But ye high heavens that all this sorrow see
Aswage your storms or else both you and she
Yet even whilst her bloody hands them slay
That they take pleasure in her cruel play
Whom she all careless of his grief contrained
And would not hear when he to her complained
Let them feel thutmost of your cruelties
But him that at your footstool humbled lies
Then with some cordials seek first to appease
And then my body shall have shortly ease
Ne aught so hard but he that would attend
So do I hope her stubborn heart to bend
There let no thought of joy or pleasure vain
But sudden dumps and dreary sad disdain
Great shame it is thing so divine in view
To make the bait her gazers to enbrew
Yet she beholding me with constant eye
But when I laugh she mocks and when I cry
Then needs another element inquire
For to the heaven her haughty looks aspire
Fair be ye sure but hard and obstinate
Gainst which a ship of succour desolate
Yet shoot ye sharply still and spare me not
Ye cruel one what glory can be got
Such self assurance need not fear the spite
But in the stay of her own steadfast might
Then by that count which lovers books invent
Which I have wasted in long languishment
The bud of joy the blossom of the morn
What reason is it then but she should scorn
Then shall the new years joy forth freshly send
And all these storms which now his beauty blend
Most happy he that can at last achieve
Whose least delight sufficeth to deprive
Her goodly bosom like a strawberry bed
Her breast like Lillies ere their leaves be shed
There pride dare not approach nor discord spill
But simple truth and mutual good will
But ye thereby much greater glory gate
For now your light doth more itself dilate
There she beholding me with milder look
Till I in hand her yet half trembling took
And that thy love we weighing worthily
And for thy sake that all like dear didst buy
Even this verse vowed to eternity
And tell her praise to all posterity
Bid her therefore herself soon ready make
Where every one that misseth than her make
But as your work is woven all above
So sweet your prison you in time shall prove
There my frail fancy fed with full delight
Ne thinks of other heaven but how it might
Do you him take and in your bosom bright
Perhaps he there may learn with rare delight
The third my love my lifes last ornament
To speak her praise and glory excellent
No so quod I let baser things devise
My verse your virtues rare shall eternize
And twixt her paps like early fruit in May
They loosly did their wanton wings display
Exceeding sweet yet void of sinful vice
Sweet fruit of pleasure brought from paradise
But when mine eyes I thereunto direct
And when I hope to see their true object
That is true beauty that doth argue you
Derivd from that fair spirit from whom all true
Till then give leave to me in pleasant mew
The contemplation of whose heavenly hue
But fairest she when so she doth display
Through which her words so wise do make their way
But since ye deigned so goodly to relent
That little that I am shall all be spent
Yet are mine eyes so filled with the store
But loath the things which they did like before
Deep in the closet of my parts entire
That me with heavenly fury doth inspire
The sparks whereof let kindle thine own fire
Consume thee quite that didst with guile conspire
Thus I the time with expectation spend
That further seems his term still to extend
Of which beholding the idea plain
With light thereof I do myself sustain
Ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove
Whose sweet aspect both God and man can move
