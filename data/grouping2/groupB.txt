That thereby beautys rose might never die
His tender heir might bear his memory
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held
Now is the time that face should form another
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
Upon thy self thy beautys legacy
And being frank she lends to those are free
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
With beautys treasure ere it be self killed
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
That thou consumst thy self in single life
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
Who for thy self art so unprovident
But that thou none lovst is most evident
In one of thine from that which thou departest
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
And sable curls all silvered oer with white
No longer yours than you your self here live
And your sweet semblance to some other give
And yet methinks I have astronomy
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
Holds in perfection but a little moment
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
If it were filled with your most high deserts
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
And summers lease hath all too short a date
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
And burn the long lived phoenix in her blood
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion
With shifting change as is false womens fashion
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
So long as youth and thou are of one date
Then look I death my days should expiate
Who with his fear is put beside his part
Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
Thy beautys form in table of my heart
And perspective it is best painters art
Of public honour and proud titles boast
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
To witness duty not to show my wit
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired
To work my mind when bodys works expired
That am debarred the benefit of rest
But day by night and night by day oppressed
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And look upon my self and curse my fate
I summon up remembrance of things past
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And all those friends which I thought buried
When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
And make me travel forth without my cloak
Hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
Although our undivided loves are one
Without thy help by me be borne alone
To see his active child do deeds of youth
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
When thou art all the better part of me
And what ist but mine own when I praise thee
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
When I am sometime absent from thy heart
For still temptation follows where thou art
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
A loss in love that touches me more nearly
For all the day they view things unrespected
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Injurious distance should not stop my way
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
Are both with thee wherever I abide
These present absent with swift motion slide
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
And each doth good turns now unto the other
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
When I shall see thee frown on my defects
Called to that audit by advised respects
When what I seek my weary travels end
Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
Till I return of posting is no need
Can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
And you but one can every shadow lend
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
Tomorrow sharpened in his former might
Upon the hours and times of your desire
Nor services to do till you require
I should in thought control your times of pleasure
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
The second burthen of a former child
So do our minutes hasten to their end
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
My heavy eyelids to the weary night
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
And all my soul and all my every part
It is so grounded inward in my heart
With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
But sad mortality oersways their power
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
As to behold desert a beggar born
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And with his presence grace impiety
And lace it self with his society
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
Or durst inhabit on a living brow
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
For slanders mark was ever yet the fair
A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
What merit lived in me that you should love
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
Without all bail shall carry me away
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
Or as sweet seasoned showers are to the ground
As twixt a miser and his wealth is found
So far from variation or quick change
To new found methods and to compounds strange
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
And found such fair assistance in my verse
And under thee their poesy disperse
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
And my sick muse doth give an other place
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
To make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
Although in me each part will be forgotten
And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
Of their fair subject blessing every book
And therefore to your fair no painting set
That barren tender of a poets debt
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
Which should example where your equal grew
While comments of your praise richly compiled
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
Bound for the prize of all too precious you
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate
My bonds in thee are all determinate
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
And I will comment upon that offence
Against thy reasons making no defence
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
And do not drop in for an after loss
Some in their wealth some in their bodys force
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
For term of life thou art assured mine
For it depends upon that love of thine
Like a deceived husband so loves face
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
That do not do the thing they most do show
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What old Decembers bareness everywhere
When proud pied April dressed in all his trim
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
So dost thou too and therein dignified
I love not less though less the show appear
The owners tongue doth publish every where
That having such a scope to show her pride
Than when it hath my added praise beside
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Have from the forests shook three summers pride
Nor my beloved as an idol show
To one of one still such and ever so
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
And made my self a motley to the view
Made old offences of affections new
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
Than public means which public manners breeds
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
So you oer green my bad my good allow
And that which governs me to go about
Seems seeing but effectually is out
Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
And that your love taught it this alchemy
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
Admit impediments love is not love
Or bends with the remover to remove
Wherein I should your great deserts repay
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
With eager compounds we our palate urge
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
Still losing when I saw my self to win
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
When not to be receives reproach of being
Not by our feeling but by others seeing
Full charactered with lasting memory
Beyond all date even to eternity
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
They are but dressings Of a former sight
It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
With my extern the outward honouring
Which proves more short than waste or ruining
Or if it were it bore not beautys name
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Is lust in action and till action lust
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
And Will to boot and Will in over plus
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
Thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
That they behold and see not what they see
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
I do believe her though I know she lies
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Use power with power and slay me not by art
My tongue tied patience with too much disdain
The manner of my pity wanting pain
For they in thee a thousand errors note
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
One of her feathered creatures broke away
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate
But when she saw my woeful state
My sinful earth these rebel powers array
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Th uncertain sickly appetite to please
Which have no correspondence with true sight
That censures falsely what they see aright
When I against my self with thee partake
Am of my self all tyrant for thy sake
With insufficiency my heart to sway
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
A maid of Dians this advantage found
In a cold valley fountain of that ground
Laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
Which hold my life in their dead doing might
Like captives trembling at the victors sight
Of th inward bale of my love pined heart
Till greater then my womb thou woxen art
Witness the world how worthy to be praised
In my frail spirit by her from baseness raised
Doth seem to promise hope of new delight
Bids all old thoughts to die in dumpish sprite
In finding fault with her too portly pride
Is of the world unworthy most envied
Doth still persist in her rebellious pride
The harder won the firmer will abide
What wondrous virtue is contained in you
Into the object of your mighty view
Kindled above unto the maker near
That to the world naught else be counted dear
Those powerful eyes which lighten my dark sprite
Resemble thimage of their goodly light
That me thou makest thus tormented be
Of her freewill scorning both thee and me
And hostages do offer for my truth
To battle and the weary war renewth
To make a truce and terms to entertain
Which sought me to entrap in treasons train
Whiles her fair face she rears up to the sky
Most goodly temperature ye may descry
Unto the siege by you abondond quite
So fair a peace for one repulse so light
Do seek most precious things to make your gain
What needeth you to seek so far in vain
On those fair eyes my loves immortal light
Through sweet illusion of her looks delight
Made to amaze weak mens confused skill
What pen what pencil can express her fill
The hardest steel in tract of time doth tear
The firmest flint doth in continuance wear
His trumpet shrill hath thrice already sounded
Who now is coming forth with garland crowned
And do mine humbled heart before her pour
And tread my life down in the lowly floor
Which tempered so the feature of her face
Do both appear tadorn her beautys grace
Men to devotion ought to be inclined
For my sweet Saint some service fit will find
Devised a web her wooers to deceive
The same at night she did again unreave
And rare perfection of each goodly part
I honor and admire the makers art
And know no end of her own mystery
Twixt fear and hope depending doubtfully
Sweet in the Juniper but sharp his bough
Sweet is the firbloom but his branches rough
Sith all worlds glory is but dross unclean
But ever now thereof ye little weene
Gives me great hope of your relenting mind
Ye wearing it do seem to me inclined
My simple meaning with disdainful scorn
Accounts myself her captive quite forlorn
How comes it then that this her cold so great
But harder grows the more I her intreat
Given so goodly gifts of beautys grace
And all those pretty ornaments deface
The hardest iron soon doth mollify
And fashion to what he it list apply
To that most sacred empress my dear dread
That mote enlarge her living praises dead
By conduct of some star doth make her way
Out of her course doth wander far astray
Still to behold the object of their pain
But having pine and having not complain
Or shall their ruthless torment never cease
Without hope of aswagement or release
She doth attire under a net of gold
That which is gold or hair may scarce be told
He forth was thrown into the greedy seas
Allured a dolphin him from death to ease
Expressing all thy mothers powerful art
When all the gods he threats with thundring dart
And tell me whereto can ye liken it
An hundred Graces as in shade to sit
To be so cruel to an humbled foe
If will then she at will may will forgo
So pleasing is in my extremest pain
The more I love and do embrace my bane
And if I speak her wrath renew I shall
Or choked be with overflowing gall
Through stubborn pride amongst themselves did war
Then Orpheus with his harp their strife did bar
Your goodly self for evermore to view
Most lively like behold your semblance true
My cruel fair straight bids me wend my way
As willing me against her will to stay
Until ye have their guilefull trains well tried
That from the foolish fish their baits do hide
Did make the matter to avenge her ire
Did sacrifice unto the greedy fire
Is it because your eyes have power to kill
And greater glory think to save than spill
Of my hearts wound and of my bodys grief
Fit medicines for my bodys best relief
Of hardest marble are of purpose made
Ne let their famous monuments to fade
I go like one that having lost the field
Despoiled of warlike arms and knowen shield
Doth please all beasts but that his looks them fray
To let thm gaze whilst he on them may prey
My love like the spectator idly sits
Disguising diversely my troubled wits
And therewith do her cruelty compare
The which her made at once so cruel fair
As is the tiger that with greediness
A feeble beast doth felly him oppress
High time it is this war now ended were
Ne your incessant battery more to bear
Unto herself and settled so in heart
Ne feared with worse to any chance start
To every planet point his sundry year
As Mars in three score years doth run his sphere
My sovereign saint the idol of my thought
Taccuse of pride or rashly blame for aught
The new begins his compassed course anew
Betokening peace and plenty to ensue
Which hardly I endured heretofore
With which my silly bark was tossed sore
Me seemed I smelled a garden of sweet flowers
For damsels fit to deck their lovers bowers
That fondly fear to lose your liberty
And make him bond that bondage erst did fly
With plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown
That ye your love lent to so mean a one
Seeing the game from him escaped away
With panting hounds beguiled of their pray
Didst make thy triumph over death and sin
Captivity thence captive us to win
Used trophies to erect in stately wise
Of their great deeds and valorous emprize
In whose coat armor richly are displayed
In goodly colors gloriously displayed
Yourself unto the bee ye do compare
In close await to catch her unaware
In mind to mount up to the purest sky
And clogged with burden of mortality
My heart whom none with servile bands can tie
Breaking his prison forth to you doth fly
With which that happy name was first designed
With gifts of body fortune and of mind
But came the waves and washed it away
But came the tide and made my pains his prey
The nest of love the lodging of delight
The sacred harbour of that heavenly sprite
A goodly table of pure ivory
The greatest prince with pompous royalty
Like a young fawn that late hath lost the hind
Whose image yet I carry fresh in mind
For that yourself ye daily such do see
And virtuous mind is much more prayed of me
Through Faery land which those six books compile
And gather to myself new breath awhile
With the loose wind ye waving chance to mark
Or in her eyes the fire of love does spark
I bless my lot that was so lucky placed
That are so much by so mean love debased
Still to behold the object of their pain
But having pine and having not complain
When I do praise her say I do but flatter
Begin his witless note apace to clatter
Of that self kind with which the Furies fell
Of poisoned words and spiteful speeches well
Many long weary days have I outworn
Their sad protract from evening until morn
The which was wont to lead my thoughts astray
Afraid of every dangers least dismay
Sits mourning for the absence of her mate
For his return that seems to linger late
