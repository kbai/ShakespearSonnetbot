But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
For never-resting time leads summer on
That use is not forbidden usury,
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
The world will be thy widow and still weep,
For thou art so possessed with murd'rous hate,
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
Making a couplement of proud compare
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
So I for fear of trust, forget to say,
For through the painter must you see his skill,
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
For then my thoughts (from far where I abide)
And each (though enemies to either's reign)
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
Then can I drown an eye (unused to flow)
How many a holy and obsequious tear
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
All men make faults, and even I in this,
In our two loves there is but one respect,
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
Even for this, let us divided live,
Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye,
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
No matter then although my foot did stand
For when these quicker elements are gone
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
O what excuse will my poor beast then find,
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye,
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,
O let me suffer (being at your beck)
O that record could with a backward look,
Nativity once in the main of light,
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
Hath travelled on to age's steepy night,
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
O how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
Before the golden tresses of the dead,
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
Nay if you read this line, remember not,
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
Why write I still all one, ever the same,
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
And therefore have I slept in your report,
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
I think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
As on the finger of a throned queen,
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
O blame me not if I no more can write!
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
That is my home of love, if I have ranged,
Most true it is, that I have looked on truth
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
You are my all the world, and I must strive,
For it no form delivers to the heart
To make of monsters, and things indigest,
But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
For why should others' false adulterate eyes
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
No it was builded far from accident,
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,
If I might teach thee wit better it were,
Nor are mine cars with thy tongue's tune delighted,
Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
To win me soon to hell my female evil,
Straight in her heart did mercy come,
Why so large cost having so short a lease,
My reason the physician to my love,
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
For thou betraying me, I do betray
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
The fairest votary took up that fire,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
That's for thy self to breed another thee,
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
When every private widow well may keep,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
If all were minded so, the times should cease,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Your self again after your self's decease,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
The age to come would say this poet lies,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
With April's first-born flowers and all things rare,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
The one by toil, the other to complain
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
As interest of the dead, which now appear,
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
For no man well of such a salve can speak,
My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
That by this separation I may give:
But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
My life being made of four, with two alone,
But the defendant doth that plea deny,
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
When love converted from the thing it was
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind,
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn:
To-morrow see again, and do not kill
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
Show me your image in some antique book,
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,
To find out shames and idle hours in me,
And for my self mine own worth do define,
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
And the firm soil win of the watery main,
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
To live a second life on second head,
In other accents do this praise confound
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
And hang more praise upon deceased I,
Which by and by black night doth take away,
The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
Now counting best to be with you alone,
That every word doth almost tell my name,
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
Have added feathers to the learned's wing,
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
The earth can yield me but a common grave,
And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
How far a modern quill doth come too short,
But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
To every hymn that able spirit affords,
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted:
As I'll my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
But these particulars are not my measure,
I see, a better state to me belongs
In many's looks, the false heart's history
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise,
So are those errors that in thee are seen,
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
Could make me any summer's story tell:
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay:
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
I see their antique pen would have expressed,
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
These blenches gave my heart another youth,
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
None else to me, nor I to none alive,
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Creating every bad a perfect best
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
And rather make them born to our desire,
Under the blow of thralled discontent,
For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,
And in some perfumes is there more delight,
To say they err, I dare not be so bold,
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Of him, my self, and thee I am forsaken,
He learned but surety-like to write for me,
Shall will in others seem right gracious,
In things of great receipt with case we prove,
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue,
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
To follow that which flies before her face:
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
Was used in giving gentle doom:
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve,
If it be not, then love doth well denote,
Nay if thou lour'st on me do I not spend
There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
My soul doth tell my body that he may,
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
And so the general of hot desire,
