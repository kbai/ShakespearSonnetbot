And only herald to the gaudy spring
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
And constant stars in them I read such art
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen
Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting
And then believe me my love is as fair
As I not for my self but for thee will
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
After a thousand victories once foiled
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
Haply I think on thee and then my state
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age
With all triumphant splendour on my brow
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
By looking on thee in the living day
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
By those swift messengers returned from thee
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
Thy self away art present still with me
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
Within the knowledge of mine own desert
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
Therefore desire of perfectst love being made
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
They live unwooed and unrespected fade
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
That you your self may privilage your time
To this composed wonder of your frame
And delves the parallels in beautys brow
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
Against confounding ages cruel knife
Or state it self confounded to decay
Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid
And folly doctor-like controlling skill
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
Without all ornament it self and true
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
Either not assailed or victor being charged
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
That you for love speak well of me untrue
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
The prey of worms my body being dead
And by and by clean starved for a look
And you and love are still my argument
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Which eyes not yet created shall oer-read
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And to the most of praise add something more
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
When other petty griefs have done their spite
Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Though to it self it only live and die
Which for their habitation chose out thee
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
If time have any wrinkle graven there
Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
To mar the subject that before was well
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
Fair kind and true varying to other words
Of this our time all you prefiguring
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
Mine appetite I never more will grind
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
Of others voices that my adders sense
The most sweet favour or deformedst creature
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
Might I not then say Now I love you best
Within his bending sickles compass come
And on just proof surmise accumulate
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
That better is by evil still made better
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
At my abuses reckon up their own
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Not wondring at the present nor the past
Which works on leases of short-numbered hours
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
And situation with those dancing chips
Had having and in quest to have extreme
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use
And in abundance addeth to his store
Though in thy stores account I one must be
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
And wherefore say not I that I am old
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
That followed it as gentle day
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest
That is so vexed with watching and with tears
That is so proud thy service to despise
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
As his triumphant prize proud of this pride
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual
And tender churl makst waste in niggarding
Proving his beauty by succession thine
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
Leaving thee living in posterity
From his low tract and look another way
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
And kept unused the user so destroys it
Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
And die as fast as they see others grow
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
To change your day of youth to sullied night
Can make you live your self in eyes of men
And stretched metre of an antique song
When in eternal lines to time thou growst
For beautys pattern to succeeding men
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
As those gold candles fixed in heavens air
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
Which I new pay as if not paid before
That due of many now is thine alone
To march in ranks of better equipage
The region cloud hath masked him from me now
To him that bears the strong offences cross
Such civil war is in my love and hate
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
And by a part of all thy glory live
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
To bear greater wrong than hates known injury
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
I must attend times leisure with my moan
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
And I am still with them and they with thee
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride
And you in every blessed shape we know
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
That wear this world out to the ending doom
Return of love more blest may be the view
Save where you are how happy you make those
Your self to pardon of self-doing crime
Or whether revolution be the same
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
Self so self-loving were iniquity
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
That Time will come and take my love away
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
And captive good attending captain ill
And proud of many lives upon his gains
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
But let your love even with my life decay
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
Too base of thee to be remembered
Save what is had or must from you be took
Spending again what is already spent
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
He of tall building and of goodly pride
When all the breathers of this world are dead
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend
When others would give life and bring a tomb
Making his style admired every where
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
I was not sick of any fear from thence
Comes home again on better judgement making
Doing thee vantage double-vantage me
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
At first the very worst of fortunes might
And having thee of all mens pride I boast
Happy to have thy love happy to die
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
And thou away the very birds are mute
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
And make times spoils despised everywhere
And to be praised of ages yet to be
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
But makes antiquity for aye his page
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
A god in love to whom I am confined
Nor double penance to correct correction
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
To trust those tables that receive thee more
Made more or less by thy continual haste
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
But mutual render only me for thee
Slandering creation with a false esteem
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
And suit thy pity like in every part
Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
One will of mine to make thy large will more
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
And age in love loves not to have years told
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind
I guess one angel in anothers hell
From heaven to hell is flown away
Within be fed without be rich no more
At random from the truth vainly expressed
The sun it self sees not till heaven clears
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
Or made them swear against the thing they see
And thither hied a sad distempered guest
For men discased but I my mistress thrall
