We present results from the models we worked on in this project. As stated above, we do counting in the poetry generation to make sure that each line in our poem consists of 10 syallables.That is to say, we actually generation our poetry line by line, at each position of line, we repeated generate lines until we get a 10-syllable line: we only took our pick of lines with 10 syllables. In counting the syllables, we use dictionary from \textit{NLTK} and package \textit{PyHyphen} to break words into syllables, we did not truncate lines during the counting, so each line is supposed to end up in the \textit{END} state (this is the same for both Hidden Markov Model and Hidden Markov Model). We only took our pick at sentence level.
