\paragraph{}\label{sec:syllablecount}
We present results from the models we worked on in this project. As stated above, we do counting in the poetry generation to make sure that each line in our poem consists of 10 syallables.That is to say, we actually generation our poetry line by line, at each position of line, we repeated generate lines until we get a 10-syllable line: we only took our pick of lines with 10 syllables. In counting the syllables, we use dictionary from \textit{NLTK} and package \textit{PyHyphen} to break words into syllables, we did not truncate lines during the counting, so each line is supposed to end up in the \textit{END} state (this is the same for both Hidden Markov Model and Hidden Markov Model). We only took our pick at sentence level.

\subsubsection{2nd order Markov Chain Model}
\paragraph{}
Here is a poem we generated from our reversed-trained 2nd order Markov Model, with automatically marked punctuation, we name it \textbf{'Beauty and Love'}:
\renewcommand{\poemtoc}{subsection}
\poemtitle{Hope or Fear?}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be?}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
They know what beauty, is see where it lies,\\
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me,\\
But tis my heart that loves what they despise,\\
So you oer green my bad my good allow:\\
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,\\
And given to time your own dear purchased right;\\
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,\\
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.\\
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,\\
And all things turns, to fair that eyes can see,\\
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\\
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be?\\
\vin Thine by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\\
\vin  So long lives this and this shall ever be.\\
\end{verse}
