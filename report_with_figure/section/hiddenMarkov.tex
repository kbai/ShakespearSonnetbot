\paragraph{}
In training HMM, we tried on several number of hidden state in our model and chose the numjber of state with the highest emission probabilities as the favorate model in the project. To be specific, we tried on models with 5, 10, 20 , 40, 80, 100, 500, 1000. We are working on model with 1000 hidden states because there are around 3000 words in Shakespeare's poetry set.
