Dost thou desire my, slumbers should be broken,
To be receives reproach of being,
With shew of morning mild he hath begun,
Not by our feeling but by others seeing:
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace;
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face.
Treading down earth as lothsome and forlorn,
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
What reason is it then but she should scorn,
Before joy proposed behind dream?
  But flowers distilled though they golden be,
  Painting my age with beauty best agree.
