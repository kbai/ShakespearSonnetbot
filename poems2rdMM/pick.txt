Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day,
What potions have drunk of siren tears,
My sinful earth these rebel powers array:

Duty so great which wit so poor as mine,
The spirit of love with perpetual dulness;
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine,
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness.

Therefore love be of thyself so wary,
Thy black is fairest, in my judgments place,
Of more delight than hawks and horses be,
To guard the lawful reasons on thy face?

  Or gluttoning on all or all away,
  Yet him for this my love was my decay.


To me fair friend, you never can be old,
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled,
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
They are but dressings of former child:
That record could with backward look,
To set form upon desired change;
Show me your image in some antique book,
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.
Possessing or pursuing no delight,
By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown,
The mountain or the sea the day or night,
At my abuses reckon up their own?
  But since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure,
  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer.


Join with the time, do not love thee not,
Then look death my bones with dust shall cover,
In faith do not think on thee when forgot,
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:

Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
Thou dost love her because thou knowst love her;
Or at the least so long as brain and heart,
In the distraction of this madding fever.

Do you him take and in possession so,
And live no more, endure on them to look,
Love to hear her speak yet well know,
Save what is had or must from you be took?

  To love that well which thou must leave ere long,
  Then do thy worst old time despite thy wrong.

:
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
how I faint when I of you do write
Men call you fair, and you do credit it
:

And for the peace, of you do write
Men call you fair, and you do write
