 when  hours  have  drained  his  blood  and  filled  his  brow 
 thou  dost  stay 
 so  shall  live  your  epitaph  to  make  me  bow 
 without  all  bail  shall  carry  me  away 
 but  thou  wilt  not  nor  he  will  not  be  free 
 though  not  to  conspire 
 was  it  his  spirit  by  spirits  taught  to  write  for  me 
 whilst  it  hath  thought  it  self  so  blessed  never 
 but  thy  eternal  summer  shall  not  fade 
 thy  adverse  party  is  thy  advocate 
 nor  shall  death  brag  thou  wandrest  in  his  shade 
 from  sullen  earth  sings  hymns  at  heavens  gate 
 this  wish  have  then  ten  times  happy  me 
 so  thou  preventst  his  scythe  and  thee

 grant  if  thou  survive  my  well  contented  day 
 even  those  that  said  hate 
 rough  winds  do  shake  the  darling  buds  of  may 
 when  that  churl  death  my  days  should  expiate 
 what  needst  thou  wound  with  cunning  when  thy  might 
 and  stops  her  pipe  in  growth  of  riper  days 
 blame  me  not  if  no  more  can  write 
 thy  worth  limit  past  my  praise 
 tis  the  first  tis  flattery  in  my  nature  reigned 
 and  wherefore  say  not  that  am  old 
 that  it  could  so  preposterously  be  stained 
 and  age  in  love  loves  not  to  have  thy  love  happy  to  have  years  told 
 compared  with  loss  of  thee  will  not  praise  that  purpose  not  to  sell 
 not  blame  your  pleasure  be  it  ill  or  well

 sigh  the  lack  of  many  thing  sought 
 hate  of  my  harmful  deeds 
 the  argument  all  bare  is  of  my  flesh  were  thought 
 than  public  means  which  public  manners  breeds 
 for  how  do  hold  thee  but  by  thy  granting 
 will  sourly  leave  her  till  he  have  prevailed 
 an  eye  more  bright  than  theirs  less  false  in  rolling 
 beauteous  thou  art  therefore  to  be  assailed 
 let  those  whom  nature  hath  not  made  for  store 
 or  to  thy  fair  health  recounting  it  to  me 
 though  love  what  others  do  abhor 
 for  bending  all  my  poverty 
 for  am  shamed  by  that  which  still  doth  grow 
 receiving  nought  by  elements  so  slow 
3
 as  easy  might  from  my  self  depart 
 with  shifting  change  as  is  false  womens  fashion 
 thou  art 
 or  you  survive  when  in  earth  am  rotten 
 whilst  her  neglected  child  holds  her  in  chase 
 suffring  my  friend  for  my  stain 
 to  follow  that  which  flies  before  her  face 
 he  robs  thee  of  and  pays  it  thee  again 
 bliss  in  proof  and  proved  very  woe 
 either  not  assailed  or  victor  being  charged 
 grant  never  saw  goddess  go 
 to  tie  up  envy  evermore  enlarged 
 only  my  plague  thus  far  count  my  gain 
 send  them  back  again 
4
 beshrew  that  heart  that  makes  my  heart  to  groan 
 who  in  despite  of  view  is  pleased  to  dote 
 ist  not  enough  to  torture  me  alone 
 for  they  in  thee  thousand  errors  note 
 seeking  that  beauteous  roof  to  ruinate 
 and  broils  root  out  the  work  of  masonry 
 thou  art  so  possessed  with  murdrous  hate 
 as  soon  as  think  the  place  where  he  would  be 
 to  what  you  will  to  you 
 not  wondring  at  the  present  doubting  of  the  rest 
 and  by  this  will  be  gainer  too 
 more  than  that  tongue  that  more  hath  more  expressed 
 incapable  of  more  replete  with  you 
 as  he  takes  from  you  engraft  you  new 
5
 for  well  thou  knowst  am  forsworn 
 my  bonds  in  thee  are  all  determinate 
 thus  is  his  cheek  the  map  of  days  outworn 
 all  alone  beweep  my  outcast  state 
 as  on  the  finger  of  throned  queen 
 divert  strong  minds  to  the  course  of  altring  things 
 that  in  thee  are  seen 
 creep  in  twixt  vows  and  change  decrees  of  kings 
 let  me  pass  untold 
 when  other  petty  griefs  have  done  their  spite 
 therefore  to  give  them  from  me  was  bold 
 than  when  her  mournful  hymns  did  hush  the  night 
 for  thee  watch  whilst  thou  dost  hide 
 by  self  example  mayst  thou  be  denied 
6
 my  self  ill  forfeit  so  that  other  mine 
 for  that  sorrow  which  then  did  feel 
 so  now  have  confessed  that  he  is  thine 
 unless  my  nerves  were  brass  or  hammered  steel 
 that  in  your  report 
 is  writ  in  moods  and  frowns  and  wrinkles  strange 
 how  far  modern  quill  doth  come  too  short 
 since  seldom  coming  in  that  cannot  know  thy  change 
 mad  in  pursuit  and  in  my  nature  reigned 
 what  strained  touches  rhetoric  can  lend 
 that  it  could  so  preposterously  be  stained 
 in  true  plain  words  by  thy  true  telling  friend 
 die  single  and  thine  image  dies  with  thee 
 this  were  to  be 
7
 alack  what  poverty  my  muse 
 but  when  she  saw  my  woeful  state 
 grant  thou  wert  not  married  to  my  use 
 bound  for  the  prize  of  all  too  short  date 
 when  every  private  widow  well  may  keep 
 the  spirit  of  love  to  stop  posterity 
 do  envy  those  jacks  that  nimble  leap 
 looking  on  darkness  which  the  blind  do  see 
 that  it  could  so  preposterously  be  stained 
 though  words  come  hindmost  holds  his  rank  before 
 what  merit  do  in  my  nature  reigned 
 if  thou  couldst  answer  this  fair  child  of  mine  to  make  thy  large  will  more 
 lest  eyes  well  seeing  thy  foul  faults  should  find 
 my  grief  lies  onward  and  my  joy  behind 
8
 shall  compare  thee  to  summers  day 
 thy  beautys  form  in  table  of  my  sin  grounded  on  sinful  loving 
 how  heavy  do  journey  on  the  way 
 thou  wilt  restore  to  be  receives  reproach  of  being 
 as  interest  of  the  watery  main 
 how  far  toil  still  farther  off  from  thee 
 and  each  though  enemies  to  eithers  reign 
 the  scope  and  tenure  of  thy  husbandry 
 my  name  be  buried  where  my  body  is 
 for  bending  all  my  poverty 
 for  she  hath  no  exchequer  now  but  his 
 dissuade  one  foolish  heart  from  serving  thee 
 pity  me  then  dear  friend 
 all  losses  are  restored  and  sorrows  end 
9
 to  thee  send  this  written  embassage 
 though  absence  seemed  my  flame  to  qualify 
 forgot  upon  your  dearest  love  to  whom  in  vassalage 
 and  dig  deep  trenches  in  thy  breast  doth  lie 
 which  in  my  sight 
 the  teeming  autumn  big  with  rich  increase 
 nor  that  full  star  that  ushers  in  the  main  of  light 
 like  widowed  wombs  after  their  lords  decease 
 therefore  love  be  of  thyself  so  wary 
 and  dumb  presagers  of  my  speaking  breast 
 thy  love  is  better  than  high  birth  to  me 
 thou  canst  not  then  say  now  love  you  best 
 then  will  swear  beauty  herself  is  black 
 and  thou  all  they  foul  that  thy  complexion  lack
