 the  other  two  slight  air  and  purging  fire 
 and  for  that  sweet  odour  which  doth  in  it  live 
 and  in  the  brain  that  ink  may  character 
 and  your  sweet  semblance  to  some  other  give 
 even  for  this  let  us  divided  live 
 by  childrens  eyes  her  husbands  shape  in  mind 
 that  by  this  separation  may  give 
 under  that  bond  that  him  as  fist  doth  bind 
 the  other  as  your  bounty  doth  appear 
 if  ten  of  thine  ten  times  refigured  thee 
 speak  of  the  spring  and  foison  of  the  year 
 or  made  them  swear  against  the  thing  they  see 
 mine  ransoms  yours  and  yours  must  ransom  me 
 but  heres  the  joy  my  friend  and  assure  ye 
1
 that  did  not  better  for  my  life  provide 
 we  sicken  to  shun  sickness  when  we  purge 
 but  when  in  disgrace  with  fortune  chide 
 with  eager  compounds  we  our  palate  urge 
 of  his  quick  objects  hath  the  mind  no  part 
 that  heavens  air  in  this  huge  rondure  hems 
 or  at  the  least  so  long  as  brain  and  heart 
 with  sun  and  moon  with  earth  and  seas  rich  gems 
 now  all  is  done  have  what  shall  have  no  end 
 and  chide  thy  beauty  and  thy  straying  youth 
 on  newer  proof  to  try  an  older  friend 
 save  where  thou  art  forced  to  break  twofold  truth 
 lest  eyes  well  seeing  thy  foul  faults  should  find 
 my  grief  lies  onward  and  my  joy  behind 
2
 tis  better  to  be  vile  than  vile  esteemed 
 in  one  of  one  still  such  and  ever  so 
 and  the  just  pleasure  lost  which  is  so  deemed 
 that  do  not  do  the  thing  they  most  do  show 
 yet  mortal  looks  adore  his  beauty  still 
 the  scope  and  tenure  of  thy  lusty  days 
 or  say  with  princes  if  it  do  not  kill 
 nor  gates  of  steel  so  strong  but  time  decays 
 they  were  but  sweet  but  figures  of  delight 
 return  of  love  more  blest  may  be  deceived 
 save  that  my  souls  imaginary  sight 
 steal  from  his  figure  and  no  pace  perceived 
 to  eat  the  worlds  due  by  the  grave  and  thee 
 if  thy  unworthiness  raised  love  in  me 
3
 and  in  the  praise  thereof  spends  all  his  might 
 in  what  sweets  dost  thou  thy  sins  enclose 
 how  can  then  return  in  happy  plight 
 and  place  my  merit  in  the  fragrant  rose 
 now  stand  you  on  the  finger  of  throned  queen 
 that  in  my  mind  thy  worst  all  best  exceeds 
 so  are  those  errors  that  in  thee  are  seen 
 when  in  the  very  refuse  of  thy  deeds 
 but  out  alack  he  was  but  one  hour  mine 
 from  thy  behaviour  beauty  doth  he  give 
 even  so  my  sun  one  early  morn  did  shine 
 to  leave  for  nothing  all  thy  glory  live 
 and  they  shall  live  such  virtue  hath  my  pen 
 so  shall  thou  feed  on  death  that  feeds  on  men 
4
 womans  gentle  heart  but  not  acquainted 
 and  what  ist  but  mine  own  when  praise  thee 
 womans  face  with  natures  own  hand  painted 
 yet  what  the  best  is  take  the  worst  to  be 
 and  weep  afresh  loves  long  since  cancelled  woe 
 and  in  my  will  no  fair  acceptance  shine 
 then  can  drown  an  eye  unused  to  flow 
 not  once  vouchsafe  to  hide  my  will  in  thine 
 the  sea  all  water  yet  receives  rain  still 
 but  shoot  not  at  me  in  your  wakened  hate 
 so  thou  being  rich  in  will  add  to  thy  will 
 and  on  just  proof  surmise  accumulate 
 which  die  for  goodness  who  have  lived  for  crime 
 but  were  some  child  of  yours  alive  that  time 
5
 if  my  dear  love  were  but  the  child  of  state 
 thy  merit  hath  my  duty  strongly  knit 
 love  is  my  sin  and  thy  dear  virtue  hate 
 to  witness  duty  not  to  show  my  wit 
 sing  to  the  ear  that  doth  thy  lays  esteem 
 and  threescore  year  would  make  the  taker  mad 
 return  forgetful  muse  and  straight  redeem 
 past  reason  hunted  and  no  sooner  had 
 that  in  thy  heart  which  will  keep  so  chary 
 eternal  numbers  to  outlive  long  date 
 yet  this  abundant  issue  seemed  to  me 
 than  those  old  nine  which  rhymers  invocate 
 to  give  back  again  and  straight  grow  sad 
 this  told  joy  but  then  no  longer  glad 
6
 how  much  more  doth  beauty  beauteous  seem 
 and  swear  that  brightness  doth  not  grace  the  day 
 the  rose  looks  fair  but  fairer  we  it  deem 
 from  limits  far  remote  where  thou  dost  stay 
 sap  checked  with  frost  and  lusty  leaves  quite  gone 
 sinks  down  to  death  oppressed  with  melancholy 
 for  never  resting  time  leads  summer  on 
 the  very  part  was  consecrate  to  thee 
 now  see  what  good  turns  eyes  for  eyes  have  done 
 though  to  it  self  it  only  live  and  die 
 are  windows  to  my  breast  where  through  the  sun 
 consumed  with  that  which  it  was  nourished  by 
 lo  thus  by  day  my  limbs  by  night  my  mind 
 for  thee  and  for  my  name  thy  love  and  am  blind 
7
 why  is  my  judgment  knew  no  reason  why 
 and  look  upon  my  self  and  curse  my  fate 
 those  lines  that  before  have  writ  do  lie 
 breathed  forth  the  sound  that  said  hate 
 the  mortal  moon  hath  her  eclipse  endured 
 such  heavenly  touches  neer  touched  earthly  faces 
 incertainties  now  crown  themselves  assured 
 when  summers  breath  their  masked  buds  discloses 
 therefore  love  be  of  thyself  so  wary 
 that  it  nor  grows  with  heat  nor  drowns  with  showers 
 bearing  thy  heart  which  will  keep  so  chary 
 which  works  on  leases  of  short  numbered  hours 
 think  all  but  one  and  me  most  wretchcd  make 
 till  then  not  show  my  head  where  thou  mayst  take 
8
 when  in  disgrace  with  fortune  and  mens  eyes 
 who  in  despite  of  view  is  pleased  to  dote 
 and  trouble  deaf  heaven  with  my  bootless  cries 
 for  they  in  thee  thousand  errors  note 
 or  if  it  do  not  from  those  lips  of  thine 
 but  is  profaned  if  not  lives  in  disgrace 
 nothing  sweet  boy  but  yet  like  prayers  divine 
 to  dry  the  rain  on  my  storm  beaten  face 
 and  ruined  love  when  it  is  built  anew 
 sets  you  most  rich  in  youth  before  my  sight 
 and  by  this  will  be  gainer  too 
 at  first  the  very  worst  of  fortunes  might 
 so  till  the  judgment  that  your  self  arise 
 so  long  lives  this  and  dwell  in  lovers  eyes 
9
 but  when  sleep  in  dreams  they  look  on  thee 
 so  far  from  variation  or  quick  change 
 thus  can  my  love  be  called  idolatry 
 to  new  found  methods  and  to  compounds  strange 
 and  in  some  perfumes  is  there  more  delight 
 though  in  our  lives  separable  spite 
 nor  are  mine  cars  with  thy  much  clearer  light 
 when  thou  thy  self  dost  give  invention  light 
 he  nor  that  affable  familiar  ghost 
 the  most  sweet  favour  or  deformedst  creature 
 as  victors  of  my  silence  cannot  boast 
 that  better  is  by  evil  still  made  better 
 give  them  thy  fingers  me  thy  lips  to  kiss 
 since  saucy  jacks  so  happy  are  in  this
